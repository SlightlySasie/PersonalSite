    <h1>Volunteer and Hobby Projects</h1>
    <p>Below you can find some of the work I have created in GIMP (an opensoure Photoshop alternative) and Canva.
        The posters have been created either on request of volunteer groups or when I was organizing events for my study association. 
        Recently I have been asked to create invitations for events.
        <br>
        <br>Lastly a big part of this gallery consists of playing cards for a pirate card game called Skull King.
        The game was discontinued and we ruined our card set by playing too much, so I took the liberty to redesign the entire deck myself. 
        I created the playing deck in GIMP and edited pictures of my friends (and their dogs) as the pirates.
        </p>
